I asked chatGPT to write me a basic 3d engine in rust.

## how would i write a wire frame 3d engine in rust programming language

To write a wireframe 3D engine in Rust programming language, you could follow these general steps:

Set up a window for rendering: You will need a window to display your wireframe models. You can use a library like GLFW or SDL2 to create a window and handle user input.

Create a camera: The camera is the virtual view that the user sees in your engine. You will need to create a 3D camera that can move around and look at different angles. You can use matrices to transform the view and projection of the camera.

Load 3D models: You will need to load 3D models from files or create them programmatically. The models will be represented by a list of vertices and edges that make up the wireframe. You can use a library like Assimp or Wavefront OBJ to load models from popular file formats.

Implement a rendering algorithm: To render the wireframe, you will need to draw lines between the vertices of the model. You can use an algorithm like Bresenham's line algorithm to draw lines efficiently.

Implement lighting and shading: To make the wireframe models look more realistic, you can implement lighting and shading. You can use a simple algorithm like Phong shading to calculate the brightness of each vertex based on the position of the camera and the direction of the light source.

Handle user input: You will need to handle user input to move the camera and interact with the models. You can use libraries like GLFW or SDL2 to handle keyboard and mouse events.

Optimize performance: Wireframe rendering can be very computationally intensive, so it's important to optimize performance wherever possible. You can use techniques like vertex buffering and frustum culling to improve performance.

Overall, creating a wireframe 3D engine in Rust requires knowledge of computer graphics, linear algebra, and software engineering principles. You can use libraries like OpenGL and GLSL to help with the graphics programming, and Rust's strong type system and memory safety features to help with the software engineering aspects.

## write a program in rust that renders 8 points connected by lines in the shape of a cube, with a moving camera

Sure, here is an example program in Rust using the wgpu graphics library that renders a cube with 8 points connected by lines, and allows the user to move the camera with the arrow keys:
